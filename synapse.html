            <p>A Second Year Computer Engineering student at D.J. Sanghvi College of Engineering.<br>
                I am an enthusiast to explore stuff and am always eager to learn new things.<br>
                In lockdown I started:<br>

    </div>
    <section>
        <div class="coding">
            <p>As I mentioned I like to explore things and coding being new to me in college it has
                garnered interest to know more about it and eventually make a career out of it.<br>
                Coding was something that scared me at first but now when I actually implement it and end
                up getting lesser errors than the previous time gives me a sense of belonging to this
                Computer Engineering field.

                    <p>I've played Basketball & Badminton professionally for 5-6 years.<br>
                        Bagged myself a <b><i>Bronze Medal</i></b> at the Mumbai Games 2019-2020 in the 
                        badminton category.<br>
                        I've also played Basketball as the School Team Captain where we were <b><i>
                        Taluka Winners</i></b> in the year 2016-2017.<br>
                        Now that college keeps me away from sports I keep myself fit by working out.

                        He is a great inspiration for most youngsters and was for me as well while I was
